Technologies Used
- IBM Cloud: Cloud platform for deployment.
- Kubernetes: Orchestration platform for containerized applications.
- Flask: Python web framework used for building microservices.
- Docker: Containerization for each microservice.
- GitHub Actions  CI/CD pipeline for automating build, test, and deployment.

Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud account
- Minikube installed on your local machine
- Docker installed
- GitHub account
Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-native-ecommerce.git
   cd cloud-native-ecommerce
   ```

2. Build Docker images for each service:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-username/product-service ./server/product-service
   docker build -t your-username/order-service ./server/order-service
   docker build -t your-username/user-service ./server/user-service
   ```

3. Push Docker images to IBM Cloud Registry:
   ```bash
   docker tag your-username/product-service <your-ibm-cloud-registry>/product-service
   docker push <your-ibm-cloud-registry>/product-service
   ```

4. Deploy using Minikube and Kubernetes:
